# Health Insurance Analysis
I was curious to find out if I could analyze the data to decide which state – from a health insurance point-of-view – would be ideal for an individual to live in (with increasing healthcare costs today, this seemed a fitting idea). The idea would be to analyze factors like number of insurance plans available for purchase, nature of plans available for purchase, number of network providers available, median costs of insurance across states, difference in co-pay/co-insurance/deductible across states, variation in benefits across plans across states, and so on, to make a case-by-case analysis for the most dynamic states with respect to insurance.
